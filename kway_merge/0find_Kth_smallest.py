Given â€˜Mâ€™ sorted arrays, find the Kâ€™th smallest number among all the arrays.

Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5
Output: 4
Explanation: The 5th smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from the merged 
list of all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]

Similar questions: find the median of all sorted arrays, i.e., k = N//2
Or merge k sorted arrays.

# we only need to push at most k tuples
