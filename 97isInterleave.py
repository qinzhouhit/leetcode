If only s1 is empty, then if previous s2 position    is interleaving and current s2 position char is equal to s3 current position    char, it is considered interleaving. similar idea applies to when s2 is     empty. when both s1 and s2 is not empty, then if we arrive i, j from i-1,    j, then if i-1,j is already interleaving and i and current s3 position     equal, it s interleaving. If we arrive i,j from i, j-1, then if i, j-1     is already interleaving and j and current s3 position equal. it is     interleaving.    '''    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:                if len(s3) != len(s1) + len(s2):            return False        # len(s1) + 1 rows; len(s2) + 1 columns        dp = [[False] * (len(s2)+1) for _ in range(len(s1)+1)]                for i in range(len(s1)+1): # rows, i-1 is the idx for s1            for j in range(len(s2)+1): # col, j-1 is the idx for s2                if i == 0 and j == 0:                    dp[i][j] = True                elif i == 0: # previous T and s2 cur char == s3 cur char                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])                elif j == 0: # previous T and s1 cur char == s3 cur char                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])                else: # arrive i, j from i-1, j, i and current s3 position equal                    # arrive i,j from i, j-1, then if i, j-1 is already interleaving                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1] ) \                        or (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])        return dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]
