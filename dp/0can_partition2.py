Count of Subset Sum (hard)
Given a set of positive numbers, find the total number of subsets whose sum 
is equal to a given number ‘S’.

Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=4
Output: 3
The given set has '3' subsets whose sum is '4': {1, 1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 3}
Note that we have two similar sets {1, 3}, because we have two '1' in our input.

upgraded version of the subset sum, since we need to cound how many instead of T/F
